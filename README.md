Advanced Player Control: Engineered 4-directional movement logic, expanding upon standard arcade mechanics for enhanced playability. 

UI/UX Excellence: Designed a multi-state interface including a dedicated "Help" screen for key bindings and a "Game Over" state for session feedback. 

State Management: Utilized custom event-handling to manage transitions between game states, ensuring a seamless user flow. 

Data Persistence: Implemented a persistent scoring system that saves and retrieves the high score (currently 34,570) using File I/O.
